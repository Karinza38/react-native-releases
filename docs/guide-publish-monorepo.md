# Publish [Monorepo Packages](./glossary.md#monorepo-packages)

> [!Warning]
> For < 0.74, you'll need to publish any picks to monorepo packages **BEFORE** release testing. For >=0.74, you can test first but will need to complete these steps **BEFORE** final `react-native` release.

* [See instructions for < 0.74](#publishing-monorepo-packages-for-react-native-versions--074)
