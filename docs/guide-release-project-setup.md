# Creating a New Release's Project

For every MINOR release, we create a Github Project to manage pick requests.  You will need to:
- create a project
- give the release crew access
- update the status
- enable the `auto-add to project` workflow to make sure picks are visible to the correct project version
- make the project publicly visible

Navigate to the **reactwg** projects page: https://github.com/orgs/reactwg/projects

## Update the status and project details
The format should be similar to the previous version.  You will have to know:
1. The release crew + github profile links
2. Target dates for: branch cut, release candidates, golden release and stable release.  Keep the status up to date throughout the release.
